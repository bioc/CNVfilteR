Changes in version 1.0.4
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Some SNV callers can produce calls with a genotype indicating that the variant actually was not found. Variants with GTs like "0/0 ./. 1/0" are now discarded.
    o Certain SNV callers can produce SNV calls with more than two alt values (multiple alt alleles). These variants are now discarded.



Changes in version 1.0.3
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Loading variants process optimized (multiple times faster)

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug when plotting a CNV with no SNV variants matching it




Changes in version 1.0.2
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug when processing variants in the limits of heterozygous.range and heterozygous.range




Changes in version 1.0.1
-------------------------

BUG FIXES
    o Fixed bug happening in loadSNPsFromVCF() when ref and alt support was 0
    o Fixed bug when processing list.support.field in loadSNPsFromVCF()
    o Added error control when allele frequency is not numeric
    o Minor fixes
